## Fixed Travel Plan

- Dates: 2027-11-17 to 2027-11-21
- Duration: 5 days / 4 nights
- Hotel: InterContinental Osaka
- Style: Luxury Slow Travel
- USJ: one day
- Dining: taste-first dining; Michelin status is neutral and should not be used as the primary label
- Shopping: luxury shopping
- Day 1 formal sequence: arrival at InterContinental Osaka, target Executive Lounge afternoon tea, rest at the hotel, Pokémon Center OSAKA in Umeda, dinner at 千房 梅田周邊店 / Chibo Umeda-area branch, then return to the hotel.
- Day 1 formal dinner: 千房 梅田周邊店 is selected; exact branch, hours, reservation rules, rating, price, and walking route from Pokémon Center OSAKA still require confirmation.
- Day 3 formal itinerary: no Kyoto. Kizu Market brunch, Namba / Nipponbashi anime models and merch, return to InterContinental Osaka for rest and Executive Lounge afternoon tea, and Osaka city sushi dinner.
- Day 3 superseded items: Kyoto sweets route, 京 鰻和 本店 lunch, 天ぷら 京星 dinner, Pokemon Center KYOTO, Kyoto International Manga Museum, and TABLEALL Reservation Request for Kyoboshi are fallback / historical only unless the user restores Kyoto.
- Day 4 formal route: Shinsaibashi-centered morning / lunch area including Pokémon Center OSAKA DX; return to InterContinental Osaka after lunch; hotel / nearby activities in the afternoon; Executive Lounge afternoon tea; Anniversary Dinner at PIERRE inside InterContinental Osaka.
- Day 4 dinner request: reserve PIERRE as an anniversary dinner and request a window table / Osaka night-view table. Seating cannot be treated as guaranteed until confirmed by the restaurant.
- Day 4 sushi note: V5.22.0 recorded sushi as a preferred Day 4 dinner cuisine, but V5.23.0 supersedes it. Keep Day 4 sushi only as fallback if the user changes back.
- Flight timing baseline: use the current BR178 / BR129 timetable for hourly planning: BR178 TPE 06:30 to KIX 10:10; BR129 KIX 18:30 to TPE 20:30. Official 2027-11 schedule, fare, aircraft, terminal, baggage, and booking status still require reconfirmation.
- Budget baseline V5.26.0: recommended total TWD 295,664 for two travelers; safety ceiling TWD 380,000 for two travelers; InterContinental Ambassador renewal USD 250, luxury handbags, jewelry, and watches are excluded from the TWD base budget and should be tracked separately.

## Day 3 Formal Plan

2027-11-19 is now formally an Osaka city slow-travel day. The formal theme is Kizu Market, Namba / Nipponbashi anime models and merch, hotel rest, Executive Lounge afternoon tea, and Osaka city sushi dinner. Do not plan Kyoto as the main Day 3 route unless the user explicitly restores it.

## Day 4 Formal Plan

2027-11-20 is formally Shinsaibashi-centered until lunch: Pokémon Center OSAKA DX / Daimaru Shinsaibashi and nearby shopping. After lunch, the route returns to InterContinental Osaka. Afternoon activities should stay at the hotel or nearby Grand Front Osaka / Umeda area, with Executive Lounge afternoon tea retained. Dinner is Anniversary Dinner at PIERRE inside InterContinental Osaka. The reservation should note the anniversary, request a window table / Osaka night-view table, and ask about an anniversary dessert message or small celebration option if available. The window / night-view table request is not guaranteed until confirmed by the restaurant.

## Budget Model

The active budget model is `database/budget_model.yml` and the customer-readable document is `docs/06_預算/2027大阪自由行_預算模型_V5.26.0.md`.

## Customer-Facing Output Rules

- Use Traditional Chinese.
- Audience is travelers/customers, not internal project maintainers.
- Keep tables simple and use the fixed columns recorded in `database/customer_facing_travel_plan.yml`.
- Mark uncertain items as 待確認, 待官方公布, or 參考價格.
- Update existing customer-facing content instead of creating parallel versions.

## Maintenance Rule

Database first, docs second, changelog last.
