## Fixed Travel Plan

- Dates: 2027-11-17 to 2027-11-21
- Duration: 5 days / 4 nights
- Hotel: InterContinental Osaka
- Style: Luxury Slow Travel
- USJ: one day
- Dining: taste-first dining; Michelin status is neutral and should not be used as the primary label
- Shopping: luxury shopping
- Day 1 formal sequence: arrival at InterContinental Osaka, target Executive Lounge afternoon tea, rest at the hotel, Pokémon Center OSAKA in Umeda, dinner near Pokémon Center OSAKA, then return to the hotel.
- Day 1 dinner candidate list exists but no candidate has been promoted to formal itinerary yet.
- Day 3 formal itinerary: Kizu Market + Kyoto sweets souvenirs + Pokemon / anime + 京 鰻和 本店 lunch + 天ぷら 京星 dinner
- Day 4 formal route: Shinsaibashi-centered morning / lunch area including Pokémon Center OSAKA DX; return to InterContinental Osaka after lunch; hotel / nearby activities in the afternoon; Executive Lounge afternoon tea; dinner cuisine preference is now sushi.
- Day 4 dinner location issue: InterContinental Osaka official FAQ currently says there is no Japanese restaurant in the hotel, so sushi dinner likely requires a hotel-nearby / Umeda / Osaka Station sushi candidate unless the hotel offering changes by 2027.
- Flight timing baseline: use the current BR178 / BR129 timetable for hourly planning: BR178 TPE 06:30 to KIX 10:10; BR129 KIX 18:30 to TPE 20:30. Official 2027-11 schedule, fare, aircraft, terminal, baggage, and booking status still require reconfirmation.

## Current Priorities

1. Daily price and open-status monitoring across watchlist sources
2. USJ strategy and official 2027 updates
3. Taste-first Osaka restaurant candidate planning
4. Flight and airport planning
5. InterContinental Osaka stay planning
6. Luxury shopping plan
7. Osaka Amazing Pass candidate plan
8. YouTube source database cleanup
9. Budget tracking
10. KKday airport transfer product 129909 details and price confirmation
11. KKday hotel-USJ transfer product 536220 details and price confirmation
12. KKday Day 3 charter product 133661 as backup only
13. Mobile roaming setup and payment confirmation
14. Customer-facing travel planning tables: itinerary, pre-trip TODO list, and budget summary
15. Day 3 official 2027 opening-hour confirmation for Kizu Market, Kyoto sweets shops, Pokemon Center KYOTO, Kyoto International Manga Museum, 京 鰻和 本店, and 天ぷら 京星
16. Tableall availability and reservation rules for 天ぷら 京星
17. Keep the current hourly itinerary aligned with current flight baseline and later official 2027 airline updates
18. Confirm Day 1 InterContinental Osaka Executive Lounge afternoon tea access and choose one formal dinner from the Day 1 Umeda candidate list only after user confirmation
19. Confirm Day 4 Shinsaibashi lunch candidate and the post-lunch return-to-hotel route
20. Search and compare Day 4 sushi dinner candidates near InterContinental Osaka / Umeda / Osaka Station, prioritizing taste, reservation feasibility, comfort, and short travel time
21. Keep PIERRE / NOKA as fallback-only if the user decides in-hotel dinner is more important than sushi

## User-Provided Confirmed Planning Inputs

- Flights: EVA Air BR178 outbound and BR129 return.
- Flight timing baseline: per user instruction, use the current schedule directly for planning: BR178 06:30 TPE to 10:10 KIX; BR129 18:30 KIX to 20:30 TPE. Official 2027-11 schedule, fare, aircraft, terminal, baggage, and booking status still require reconfirmation.
- Day 1 sequence: after arrival at the hotel, the user wants to use afternoon tea, rest a bit, then go to Umeda Pokémon Center, eat dinner near the Pokémon Center, and return to the hotel.
- Day 1 dinner candidates near Pokémon Center OSAKA / Umeda have been added, but no final dinner has been selected yet.
- Travel insurance budget amount: TWD 6,900; payment status needs confirmation.
- Internet: phone roaming for two people, total TWD 499; eSIM / SIM / Pocket Wi-Fi are backup only.
- Airport transfer: use KKday product 129909 both ways between KIX and InterContinental Osaka.
- USJ transfer: use KKday product 536220 both ways between InterContinental Osaka and Universal Studios Japan.
- Dining: choose restaurants because they are good; Michelin status does not matter either way.
- Customer-facing output: always maintain the three simple tables requested by the user: 行程表, 行前提醒／TODO LIST, 預算表.
- Day 3 formal itinerary: 木津市場＋京都甜點伴手禮＋寶可夢／動漫＋京 鰻和 本店午餐＋天ぷら 京星晚餐.
- Day 3 dinner reservation method: TABLEALL Reservation Request for 天ぷら 京星; current reference JPY 25,500 including TABLEALL booking fee JPY 8,000; 2027-11-19 availability and cancellation rules need reconfirmation.
- Day 4 formal route: 2027-11-20 activity range should be Shinsaibashi-centered; after lunch return to InterContinental Osaka; afternoon should stay at / near the hotel; dinner preference is now sushi.
- Day 4 sushi dinner issue: InterContinental Osaka currently has no Japanese restaurant, so the project must search for hotel-nearby / Umeda / Osaka Station sushi candidates unless the user later prioritizes in-hotel dining over sushi.
- Day 3 transport: public rail plus short taxi is the primary plan; KKday #133661 10-hour charter is backup only for rain, fatigue, heavy shopping, or door-to-door comfort.

## Day 3 Formal Plan

2027-11-19 is no longer a candidate. The formal theme is Kizu Market, Kyoto lunch, Kyoto sweets souvenirs, Pokemon Center KYOTO, Kyoto International Manga Museum / anime interests, and Gion / Higashiyama photo walk, ending with 天ぷら 京星 dinner. Keep the route relaxed and do not overload with temple collection. Reconfirm 2027 official opening hours, closures, reservation windows, events, product availability, prices, fees, and cancellation rules before departure.

## Day 4 Formal Plan

2027-11-20 is formally Shinsaibashi-centered until lunch: Pokémon Center OSAKA DX / Daimaru Shinsaibashi and nearby shopping. After lunch, the route returns to InterContinental Osaka. Afternoon activities should stay at the hotel or nearby Grand Front Osaka / Umeda area, with Executive Lounge afternoon tea retained. Dinner cuisine preference is now sushi. Because the hotel currently has no Japanese restaurant, sushi dinner should be planned as a hotel-nearby / Umeda / Osaka Station candidate unless the user later explicitly prioritizes in-hotel dining over sushi. Do not promote PIERRE / NOKA as final dinner unless the user accepts non-sushi in-hotel dining.

## Customer-Facing Output Rules

- Use Traditional Chinese.
- Audience is travelers/customers, not internal project maintainers.
- Keep tables simple and use the fixed columns recorded in `database/customer_facing_travel_plan.yml`.
- Mark uncertain items as 待確認, 待官方公布, or 參考價格.
- Update existing customer-facing content instead of creating parallel versions.

## Maintenance Rule

Database first, docs second, changelog last.
