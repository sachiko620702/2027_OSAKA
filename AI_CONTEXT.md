## User-Provided Confirmed Planning Inputs

- Flights: EVA Air BR178 outbound and BR129 return; official 2027-11 schedule and fare need confirmation.
- Travel insurance budget amount: TWD 6,900; payment status needs confirmation.
- Internet: phone roaming for two people, total TWD 499; eSIM / SIM / Pocket Wi-Fi are backup only.
- Airport transfer: use KKday product 129909 both ways between KIX and InterContinental Osaka.
- USJ transfer: use KKday product 536220 both ways between InterContinental Osaka and Universal Studios Japan.
- Dining: choose restaurants because they are good; Michelin status does not matter either way.
- Customer-facing output: always maintain the three simple tables requested by the user: 行程表, 行前提醒／TODO LIST, 預算表.
- Day 1 formal stop: 梅田 Pokémon Center OSAKA.
- Day 3 formal itinerary: 木津市場＋京都甜點伴手禮＋寶可夢／動漫＋京 鰻和 本店午餐＋天ぷら 京星晚餐.
- Day 3 dinner reservation method: TABLEALL Reservation Request for 天ぷら 京星; current reference JPY 25,500 including TABLEALL booking fee JPY 8,000; 2027-11-19 availability and cancellation rules need reconfirmation.
- Day 4 formal stop: Pokémon Center OSAKA DX and InterContinental Osaka Executive Lounge afternoon tea.
- Day 3 transport: public rail plus short taxi is the primary plan; KKday #133661 10-hour charter is backup only for rain, fatigue, heavy shopping, or door-to-door comfort.

## Day 3 Formal Plan

2027-11-19 is no longer a candidate. The formal theme is Kizu Market, Kyoto lunch, Kyoto sweets souvenirs, Pokemon Center KYOTO, Kyoto International Manga Museum / anime interests, and Gion / Higashiyama photo walk, ending with 天ぷら 京星 dinner. Keep the route relaxed and do not overload with temple collection. Reconfirm 2027 official opening hours, closures, reservation windows, events, product availability, prices, fees, and cancellation rules before departure.

## Customer-Facing Output Rules

- Use Traditional Chinese.
- Audience is travelers/customers, not internal project maintainers.
- Keep tables simple and use the fixed columns recorded in `database/customer_facing_travel_plan.yml`.
- Mark uncertain items as 待確認, 待官方公布, or 參考價格.
- Update existing customer-facing content instead of creating parallel versions.

## Maintenance Rule

Database first, docs second, changelog last.
