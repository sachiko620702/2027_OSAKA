# Project Rule

This repository is the source of truth for the 2027 Osaka travel project.

Do not change these without an explicit user request:

- 2027-11-17 to 2027-11-21
- Five days and four nights
- InterContinental Osaka
- Luxury Slow Travel
- One USJ day
- Taste-first dining; Michelin status neutral
- Luxury shopping
- Day 1 formal sequence: arrival at InterContinental Osaka, target Executive Lounge afternoon tea, rest at the hotel, Pokemon Center OSAKA in Umeda, dinner at 千房 梅田周邊店 / Chibo Umeda-area branch, then return to the hotel
- Day 3 formal itinerary: no Kyoto; Kizu Market brunch, Namba / Nipponbashi anime models and merch, return to InterContinental Osaka for rest and Executive Lounge afternoon tea, and Osaka city sushi dinner

Current user-confirmed planning inputs:

- Flights: EVA Air BR178 outbound and BR129 return.
- Flight timing baseline: use the current timetable directly for hourly planning: BR178 06:30 TPE to 10:10 KIX; BR129 18:30 KIX to 20:30 TPE. Official 2027-11 schedule, fare, aircraft, terminal, baggage, and booking status still need confirmation before ticketing.
- Flight budget reference: TWD 35,000 for two travelers round trip, user-provided; final ticket price still needs confirmation.
- Day 1 arrival sequence: use afternoon tea at the hotel, rest a bit, go to Umeda Pokémon Center, eat dinner at 千房 梅田周邊店 / Chibo Umeda-area branch, and return to the hotel. Exact Chibo branch still needs confirmation.
- Day 3 sequence: Kizu Market brunch, move to Namba / Nipponbashi, anime / model / merch shopping in Nipponbashi, Namba / Dotonbori / Shinsaibashi lunch, return to InterContinental Osaka, Executive Lounge afternoon tea, and Osaka city sushi dinner.
- Day 3 dinner request: dinner should be sushi in Osaka city. Restaurant candidate, price, reservation route, cancellation policy, and transportation need confirmation.
- Day 3 superseded route: Kyoto sweets route, 京 鰻和 本店 lunch, 天ぷら 京星 dinner, Pokemon Center KYOTO, Kyoto International Manga Museum, and TABLEALL Reservation Request for Kyoboshi are fallback / historical only.
- Day 4 sequence: Shinsaibashi / Daimaru Shinsaibashi / Pokémon Center OSAKA DX before and around lunch; after lunch return to InterContinental Osaka; afternoon at or near the hotel; dinner is PIERRE Anniversary Dinner.
- Day 4 dinner request: reservation notes should request an anniversary dinner, window seat / Osaka night-view table, and optional anniversary dessert message or small celebration support if available. Seating is not guaranteed until confirmed by the restaurant.
- Day 4 sushi caveat: V5.22.0 sushi preference is superseded by V5.23.0 PIERRE Anniversary Dinner. Keep Day 4 sushi only as fallback if the user changes back.
- Travel insurance budget amount: TWD 6,900; payment status needs confirmation.
- Internet: phone roaming for two people. Amount is TWD 499.
- Airport transfer: use KKday #129909 both ways between KIX and InterContinental Osaka. V5.24.0 user-provided reference is TWD 2,600 each way, TWD 5,200 round trip.
- USJ transfer: use KKday #536220 both ways between InterContinental Osaka and Universal Studios Japan. V5.24.0 user-provided screenshot reference is TWD 1,732 each way, TWD 3,464 round trip.
- Budget model: use V5.25.0 recommended total TWD 324,664 for two travelers and safety ceiling TWD 380,000. Luxury handbags, jewelry, and watches are separate.
- Dining: restaurants should be selected because they are good. Michelin status does not matter either way and should not be used as the main planning label.
- Customer-facing output: maintain a traveler/customer readable three-table format consisting of itinerary, pre-trip TODO list, and budget summary.

Before adding content, check existing docs, database files, and changelog.

When content already exists, update or merge it instead of creating a duplicate.

## Customer-facing table rule

The customer-facing planning document must remain simple and easy to read.

Required output order:

1. 旅遊行程總覽
2. 行程表
3. 行前提醒／TODO LIST
4. 預算表
5. 費用統計
6. 待確認事項
7. 補充說明

Required tables:

- 行程表: 日期, 行程重點, 主要地點, 交通安排, 餐食安排, 備註
- 行前提醒／TODO LIST: 項目, 建議完成時間, 狀態, 提醒說明
- 預算表: 分類, 內容說明, 預估費用, 已付款, 備註

Budget categories are fixed as:

- 交通
- 住宿
- 購物
- 飲食
- USJ
- 其他

If information is not confirmed, mark it as 待確認, 待官方公布, 暫估, or 參考價格. Do not present uncertain prices as final.

If daily maintenance changes anything, regenerate GitHub Pages outputs before commit and push:

- root `index.md`
- `docs/index.md`
- `docs/14_自動同步狀態/每日同步狀態.md`

Use official sources first. When information is uncertain, mark it as NEEDS_RECONFIRMATION. When 2027 official information is not published yet, mark it as PENDING_OFFICIAL_ANNOUNCEMENT.

Every major update must update CHANGELOG and the version document.
