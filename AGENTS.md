This repository is maintained by ChatGPT and Codex.

ChatGPT handles travel decisions, prioritization, itinerary fit, budget impact, and integration.

Codex handles repository maintenance, formatting, duplicate checks, Markdown and YAML cleanup, and changelog consistency.

Required process:

1. Read README first.
2. Check existing docs and database before edits.
3. Update existing entries instead of creating duplicates.
4. Keep fixed assumptions unchanged unless the user explicitly changes them.
5. Record major changes in CHANGELOG.
