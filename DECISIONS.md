Decision: Use TABLEALL Reservation Request as the primary recorded reservation method for 天ぷら 京星 unless a better official route is confirmed.  
Status: selected; 2027-11-19 availability, price, booking fee, and cancellation policy need reconfirmation.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.

## D022 Day 4 Pokemon Center Osaka DX

Decision: 2027-11-20 Day 4 includes Pokémon Center OSAKA DX and the Day 4 activity area is Shinsaibashi-centered before and around lunch.  
Status: fixed, store hours and event rules pending.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.

## D023 Day 4 Executive Lounge afternoon tea

Decision: 2027-11-20 Day 4 includes InterContinental Osaka Executive Lounge afternoon tea after returning from Shinsaibashi.  
Status: fixed, lounge access and 2027 afternoon tea hours pending.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.

## D024 Flight timetable baseline

Decision: For hourly itinerary planning, use the current EVA Air timetable directly: BR178 TPE 06:30 to KIX 10:10; BR129 KIX 18:30 to TPE 20:30.  
Status: planning baseline; not a ticketed or official 2027-11 confirmation.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user explicitly instructed that the flight schedule should directly use the current timetable.  
Impact: Day 1 now assumes KIX arrival at 10:10 and hotel arrival around early afternoon; Day 5 now assumes KIX departure at 18:30 and allows a relaxed morning / early afternoon before airport transfer.

## D025 Day 1 afternoon tea and Umeda sequence

Decision: Day 1 sequence is hotel arrival, InterContinental Osaka Executive Lounge afternoon tea target, rest at the hotel, Pokémon Center OSAKA in Umeda, dinner near Pokémon Center OSAKA, then return to InterContinental Osaka.  
Status: fixed preference, implementation pending 2027 hotel lounge policy, arrival timing, store hours, and final branch confirmation for dinner.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user specified that after afternoon tea they want to rest, then go to Umeda Pokémon Center, eat dinner nearby, and return to the hotel.  
Impact: Day 1 dinner should stay near Pokémon Center OSAKA / Umeda. The afternoon schedule should not move directly from afternoon tea to shopping without a rest block.

## D026 Day 4 Shinsaibashi-centered route

Decision: 2027-11-20 Day 4 activity range should be Shinsaibashi-centered before and around lunch, with Pokémon Center OSAKA DX / Daimaru Shinsaibashi as the anchor.  
Status: fixed preference, implementation pending 2027 store hours, event rules, lunch candidate selection, and traffic conditions.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user specified that the Day 4 activity range should mainly be Shinsaibashi.  
Impact: Do not plan Day 4 as a mixed Shinsaibashi + Umeda + Namba long shopping day. Keep the morning / lunch area concentrated around Shinsaibashi.

## D027 Day 4 post-lunch return to hotel

Decision: After Day 4 lunch, return to InterContinental Osaka and keep afternoon activity at or near the hotel.  
Status: fixed preference, implementation pending final lunch location and transport choice.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user specified that after lunch they want to return to the hotel and do activities near the hotel.  
Impact: Day 4 afternoon should not include distant attractions. Keep Executive Lounge afternoon tea, hotel rest, Grand Front Osaka / Umeda nearby walk, and low-effort shopping only.

## D028 Day 4 hotel in-house dinner

Decision: Day 4 dinner is planned inside InterContinental Osaka, with PIERRE now selected as the primary formal direction for Anniversary Dinner.  
Status: active again through D031.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user explicitly changed Day 4 dinner back to PIERRE for an anniversary dinner with a window / Osaka night view request.  
Impact: The Day 4 evening should remain in-hotel and low-effort after Shinsaibashi, with PIERRE as the primary dinner direction.

## D029 Day 4 sushi dinner preference

Decision: Day 4 dinner cuisine preference was previously recorded as sushi.  
Status: superseded by D031 Anniversary Dinner at PIERRE.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user later stated: “Anniversary Dinner Pierre的靠窗座位，盡享大阪夜景美景。”  
Impact: Sushi is no longer the primary Day 4 dinner direction. Keep sushi only as a fallback if the user changes back.

## D030 Day 1 formal dinner direction

Decision: Day 1 dinner after Pokémon Center OSAKA should be 千房 梅田周邊店 / Chibo Umeda-area branch.  
Status: formal dinner direction; exact branch pending confirmation.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user explicitly selected 千房 梅田周邊店 from the Day 1 Umeda dinner candidates.  
Impact: Day 1 dinner is no longer only a candidate list. Keep dinner in the Chibo / Umeda branch direction, but do not record a specific branch as final until Google Maps / official source / Tabelog confirms the best actual branch, hours, reservation rules, price, and walking route from Pokémon Center OSAKA.

## D031 Day 4 Anniversary Dinner at PIERRE

Decision: 2027-11-20 Day 4 dinner should be Anniversary Dinner at PIERRE, with a window seat / Osaka night view request.  
Status: formal dinner direction; reservation, menu, price, cancellation policy, and seat assignment pending confirmation.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user explicitly stated: “Anniversary Dinner Pierre的靠窗座位，盡享大阪夜景美景。”  
Impact: Day 4 dinner should be planned around PIERRE at InterContinental Osaka. Reservation notes must request an anniversary dinner, a window / Osaka night-view seat, and optionally an anniversary dessert message or photo support. The window seat is a request, not a guarantee, until confirmed by the restaurant.

## D032 Budget model V5.24.0

Decision: Use V5.24.0 budget model as the current planning baseline: recommended total TWD 327,664 for two travelers, safety ceiling TWD 380,000 for two travelers, with luxury handbags, jewelry, and watches budgeted separately.  
Status: active budget baseline; 2027 prices still pending reconfirmation.  
Changed: 2026-07-06.  
Reason: The user corrected overestimated transportation assumptions: flight budget TWD 35,000, airport transfer TWD 2,600 each way, and USJ transfer TWD 1,732 each way.  
Impact: The previous high-level estimate is superseded. Budget tracking should use `database/budget_model.yml` and `docs/06_預算/2027大阪自由行_預算模型_V5.24.0.md` as the current model.
