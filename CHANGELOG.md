- Updated `web/index.html`, `database/budget_model.yml`, `database/customer_facing_travel_plan.yml`, `docs/06_預算/2027大阪自由行_預算模型_V5.26.0.md`, `docs/15_顧客版資料/旅遊規劃三表.md`, `docs/15_顧客版資料/旅遊常用表格總覽.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_RULE.md`, `AI_CONTEXT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `WATCHLIST.md`, and `database/project.yaml`.

### Reason

The user asked to change the shopping budget from NT$40,000 to NT$10,000.

### Impact

- The active shopping category is now smaller and the main TWD budget is lower.
- The safety ceiling remains unchanged at NT$380,000.
- Historical notes that describe earlier budget revisions are left intact where they are clearly archival.

## V5.33.0 - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Updated the active accommodation wording across the website and current budget/customer-facing documents to clarify that the stay is split into two booking orders, not a single four-night order.
- Adjusted `web/index.html`, `database/budget_model.yml`, `database/customer_facing_travel_plan.yml`, `docs/15_顧客版資料/旅遊規劃三表.md`, and `docs/15_顧客版資料/旅遊常用表格總覽.md`.
- Added version note `docs/13_版本與更新/V5.33.0_Web_Accommodation_Booking_Split.md`.

### Reason

The user corrected the accommodation structure and said it should be understood as two separate bookings rather than one direct four-night booking.

### Impact

- Current materials now reflect the booking structure more accurately.
- The total stay length remains four nights.
- No budget amount changed; this is a wording and structure clarification.

## V5.32.0 - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Removed the now-unused itinerary rhythm styles from `web/styles.css`.
- Added version note `docs/13_版本與更新/V5.32.0_Web_Remove_Itinerary_Chart.md`.

### Reason

The user said the itinerary chart was still hard to understand and wanted it removed.

### Impact

- The itinerary section is now easier to read because only the daily cards remain.
- Budget, calendar, and key-date visuals are unchanged.
- No planning values were changed; this is a presentation cleanup.

- Added tree node and nested leaf styles to `web/styles.css`.
- Added version note `docs/13_版本與更新/V5.31.0_Web_Budget_Tree.md`.

### Reason

The user wanted the six budget categories to behave more like a tree so the subitems are easier to inspect on demand.

### Impact

- Budget categories now appear as expandable nodes with nested subitems.
- The homepage is easier to scan by category while still preserving the detailed amounts.
- No planning values were changed; this is a presentation-only update.

- Updated `web/styles.css` with a reusable section-note style for explanatory text.
- Added version note `docs/13_版本與更新/V5.30.0_Web_Itinerary_Helper_Text.md`.

### Reason

### Impact

- The itinerary visuals now explain what the bars and day cards mean.
- The calendar section now explains how to read the dates and tasks.
- No planning values were changed; this is a usability update.

## V5.29.0 - 2026-07-07

- Updated `web/styles.css` with the chart layout, legend, and scenario bar styles.
- Added version note `docs/13_版本與更新/V5.28.0_Web_Budget_Charts.md`.

### Impact

- Public-facing content is now clearly separated from repository source data.
- The `web/` folder holds the main site presentation files.
- Root and `docs/` homepages now act only as pointers.
